# Provolone Olive Bread

Makes 3 loaves

Preparation time including rising and baking: 3.5 hours; active time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 0.5 cup warm water
* 3.5 cups plus 1 tablespoon bread flour
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 cup lukewarm water
* 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped
* 1 pound sharp provolone cheese, cut into 0.75 inch cubes 
* 0.5 cup pitted green olives, coarsely chopped
* 1 egg, beaten
* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds

Note: cheese can be substituted with gruyere, gouda, or other suitable melting cheese.

## Steps

In a small bowl, whisk the yeast into the warm water until dissolved. Let stand for 5 minutes.

In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl, combine the 3.5 cups[^flour] flour and the salt.

[^flour]: note: original recipe says `3 cups` here but I believe that is a typo.

### If using a stand mixer

Add the yeast mixture and luke-warm water to the bowl. Using the paddle attachment on low speed, mix until the ingredients are combined, about 2 minutes. Switch to the dough hook, increase the mixer speed to medium, and knead for 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, silky, and elastic. In a small bowl, toss the chopped onion with the 1 tablespoon flour. Add the onion to the dough and continue to knead on medium speed until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Flatten it into a 1-inch-thick- round and place the cheese and olives in the center. Gather the dough around the cheese and olives and knead just until they are evenly distributed. (Kneading the dough too long will break up the cheese, and the olives will turn the dough a muddy color.)

### If making by hand

Add the yeast mixture and luke-warn water to the bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are combined. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for at least 12 minutes, or until the dough is smooth, silky, and elastic. In a small bowl, toss the chopped onion with the 1 tablespoon flour. Flatten the dough into a 1-inch-thick round and place the onion in the center. Father the dough around the onion and knead until well incorporated, about 2 minutes. Flatten the dough once again, add the cheese and olives, and knead just until they are evenly distributed. (Kneading the dough too long will break up the cheese, and the olives will turn the dough a muddy color.)

### Next

Form the dough into a ball and place it in a large oiled bowl. Turn the dough over to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Lightly dust 2 baking sheets with flour. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and divide it into 3 pieces. Gently form each piece into a loose round (external link) and cover it with a floured kitchen towel. Let rest for 10 minutes. Shape the roundes into 3-stranded braids (external link). Place 2 of the loaves on a prepared pan at least 4 inches apart, and place the third loaf in the center of the second pan. Cover with a floured kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 45 minutes, or until increased in size by one-third and a finger pressed into the dough leaves an impression.

Fifteen minutes before the loaves have finished rising, arrange the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F.

Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of the loaves with the beaten egg and sprinkle them with the sesame seeds.

Bake for 20 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets top to bottom and front to back. Bake 20 minutes longer, for a total baking time of 40 minutes, or until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
